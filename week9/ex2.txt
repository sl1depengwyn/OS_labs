High hit/miss ratio:
Sequence: 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4
Number of pages = 2
Hits = 12
Misses = 4
Ratio = 3

Low hit/miss ratio:
Sequence: 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
Number of pages = 3
Hits = 0
Misses = 16
Ratio = 0

The aging algorithm is based on temporal locality principle i.e. if at one point a particular page is referenced,
then it is likely that the same page will be referenced again in the near future.
So, if we request same page many times in row or within the period less than number of pages we get high hit/miss ratio.
On the contrary, if we request page outside of period that is equal to number of pages we will get low hit/miss ratio
