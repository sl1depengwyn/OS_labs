If we know whether granting a resource is safe or not we can use avoidance strategy.

If there is a possibility to preempt resources than we can use recovery through preemption.

If we can introduce kind of checkpoints to restart process from certain point than we can use recovery through rollback.

If there is a possibility to freely kill processes(all process are not so important or can be restarted without any consequences)
than we can use simple recovery through killing processes.

In case when we are not allowed to do anything(preempting resources, killing processes, introducing checkpoints) or we do not
know whether granting a resource is safe or not we use prevention strategy.
