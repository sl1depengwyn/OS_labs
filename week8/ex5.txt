Virtual addresses are those that seen by processes, in fact, almost
always processes access memory using different addresses that are just 
mapped by virtual addresses using MMU, that's why virtual addresses 
called so. More over virtual addresses can be out of boundaries of 
real memory thereby making real memory "larger", but in reality they 
simply can be stored on the disk.
